The Big Gametype and Mapping Update!

* GAMETYPE SYSTEM:
	A rewritten gametype system has been introduced:
		- gametypes can be instantly changed in-game
		- 'callvote gametype' now actually works!
		- 'g_gametype' cvar sets gametype by index number, this is the current list:
				0: Campaign (not used at present, use deathmatch 0 as usual)
				1. Free for All
				2. Duel
				3. Team Deathmatch
				4. Capture the Flag
				5. Clan Arena
				6. Freeze Tag
				7. CaptureStrike
				8. Red Rover
				9. Last Man Standing
				10. Horde
		- Obsolete gametype cvars such as 'duel' have been removed. For compatibility purposes, all that remain are 'ctf' and 'teamplay' but these are overridden by g_gametype.
		- New command for admins: "gametype [gametype_name]" changes the gametype to the specified name, effectively the same as callvote gametype.

* NEW GAMETYPE:
	- Horde: Battle waves of monsters, stay on top of the scoreboard while defeating up to 16 waves to be victorious!
	- Clan Arena: Rocket Arena's famous round-based team elimination mode - no item spawns, no self-damage and a full arsenal of weapons.
	- CaptureStrike: A Threewave classic, combines Clan Arena, CTF and Counter Strike. Teams take turns attacking or defending and battle until one team is dead, or the attacking team captures the flag.
	- Red Rover: Another Rocket Arena mode, a unique full arsenal arena mode where players switch teams on death. Once there are no players remaining on a team - or a player hits the score limit, the player with the highest score wins.
	- Freeze Tag
	- Last Man Standing
