# Welcome to Muff Mode BETA!

## What is Muff Mode?
Muff Mode is a server-side mod for [QUAKE II Remastered](https://github.com/id-Software/quake2-rerelease-dll) providing overall enhances functionality and refinements.

### It is for Server Hosts
With a focus on multiplayer, it provides refined match handling and an extensive set of new capabilities for server owners to configure the game in a host of new ways.

### It is for Level Designers
New creative possibilities are unlocked for level designers, with an array of new map entities and keys and a range of added gametypes to design for.

### It is for the Players(tm)
Enhanced HUD info and a number of changable settings.

## Installation
1. Locate your installation. For Steam, this is normally "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Quake 2\rerelease".
2. Back up your baseq2/game_x64.dll.
3. Download the latest [Muff Mode release](https://github.com/themuffinator/muffmode/releases/latest).
4. Extract the entire zip to your "Quake 2" folder (not rerelease), allow file replacements (unless you already have Muff Mode, this should only replace the .dll).
5. Load the game up as normal. A range of configs can be executed to apply settings once a game has been set up.
6. Once a lobby has been set up, you can execute the included server config via ``exec muff-sv.cfg``.

## What's in the Bag?
Muff Mode includes the game logic, a server config, bot files and some map entity overrides all straight out of the bag!

## Feature Overview

- A whole host of controls for admins, voting and more.
- Refined match handling with conditional progression, including: warmups, readying, countdowns, post-match delays, sudden death, overtime and more.
- Enhanced teamplay with team auto-balancing, forced balancing rules, improved team handling, communicating joined team to players, major item pickup and weapon drop POI's, and friendly fire warnings.
- Extensive controls over specific map item spawns and entity string overrides.
- EyeCam spectating, smooth and with aim prediction (mostly!)
- MyMap map queing system inspired by tastyspleen.net.
- A number of bug fixes, minor refinements, balance tweaks and many new server settings added.
- Muff Maps: official maps under development included utilizing Muff Mode's enhanced capabilities
- Many more features, see release changelogs for more info!

### Muff Maps
- Almost Lost [ALpha v1] (mm-almostlost-a1)
  Left out from Quake III: Arena's release, this level was eventually finished off and officially released as a seperate map as pro-q3tourney7. Revised in Quake Live, this map is streamlined for fast-paced FFAs and Duels.
- Arena of Death [Alpha v3] (mm-arena-a3)
  A small and simple gem from Quake III: Arena.
- Hidden Fortress [Alpha v4] (mm-fortress-a4)
  A small-to-medium-sized level connected via two teleporters. Originally created by Raster Productions for Quake III for Dreamcast, this offers the revised layout found in Quake Live.
- Longest Yard [Beta v2] (mm-longestyard-b2)
  The quintessential space map from Quake III: Arena.
- Proving Grounds [Alpha v4] (mm-proving-a4)
  A small Duel map from Quake III: Arena.
- Vertical Vengeance [Alpha v2] (mm-vengeance-a2)
  A small Duel map from Quake III: Arena.

### New Gametypes
- Horde: Battle waves of monsters, stay on top of the scoreboard while defeating up to 16 waves to be victorious! Note: currently does not handle limited lives.
- Duel: Go head-to-head with an opponent. The victor goes on to face their next opponent in the queue.
- Clan Arena: Rocket Arena's famous round-based team elimination mode - no item spawns, no self-damage and a full arsenal of weapons.
- CaptureStrike: A Threewave classic, combines Clan Arena, CTF and Counter Strike. Teams take turns attacking or defending and battle until one team is dead, or the attacking team captures the flag.
- Red Rover: Clan Arena style where teams are changed on death. When a team has been eliminated, the round ends.

### New Game Modifications
- Vampiric Damage: Gain health by inflicting damage on your foes! No health pickups and a draining health value means the pressure is on!
- Nade Fest: Grenade-only mode.
- Weapons Frenzy: Intensified combat! Faster rates of fire, faster rockets, regenerating ammo, faster weapon switching.
- Quad Hog: Find the Quad Damage to become the Quad Hog!

### Deathmatch Refinements
- Intermission pre-delay: a one second intermission pre-delay means you can see your winning frag or capture before final scores (no damage is taken or additional scoring during this delay).
- Minimum respawn delay: a short respawn delay helps avoid accidental respawning and creates a smoother transition.
- Kill beeps and frag messages highlight your frags and rank.
 
### Offhand Hook
- Added 'hook' and 'unhook' commands to use off-hand hook. Use `g_grapple_offhand 1` to enable this.
- Players can use ``alias +hook hook; alias -hook unhook; bind mouse2 +hook`` to use it as a button command

### Gameplay Tweaks and Fixes
 - Instagib and Nade Fest now give players regeneration to recover from environmental damage, falling damage etc.
 - Quad and Protection player color shells don't change depending on team, avoids confusion
 - func_rotating: Rotating map entities now explode non-player ents such as dropped items, practically this means no more blocked rotator in dm5.
 - Player Feedback:
	* Added Fragging Spree award - broadcasted message "x is on a fragging spree with x frags" per every 10 frags achieved without dying or killing a team mate
 - Techs: fixed not being able to pick up your dropped tech
 - Blaster and Grapple now both droppable and can spawn in world
 - Current weapon is now droppable
 - Smart weapon auto-switch: now switches to SSG from SG, CG from MG, never auto-switches to chainfist.
 - Instant gametype changing (eg: from FFA to TDM)
 - DuelFire Damage has been changed to Haste: 50% faster movement, 50% faster weapon rate of fire.
 - Many more!

## Rulesets
Alter the gameplay balance by changing the ruleset.

### Quake II Rerelease (g_ruleset 1)
Everything remains as is.

### Muff Mode (g_ruleset 2)
This ruleset aims to tackle a few significant imbalances in the original game:
 - **Plasma Beam** DM damage reduced from 15 to 10, maximum range limited to 768 units (same as LG in Q3)
 - **Railgun**: restored to 150 damage in campaigns, rail knockback is now equal to damage*2 (no difference in DM).
 - **Slugs/Railgun**: reduced slugs quantity from 10 to 5, should force more dynamic and challenging gameplay instead of an instagib approach to some matches.
 - **Rockets**: removed randomised direct rocket damage value (rand 100-120), now a consistent 120.
 - **Invulnerability** powerup has been replaced by Protection - player receives no splash damage, full protection from slime damage, third protection from lava, half direct damage after armor protection.
 - **Adrenaline**: item now also increases max health by 5 during deathmatch.
 - **Rebreather**: increased holding time from 30 to 45 seconds.
 - **Auto Doc**: regen time increased from 500 ms to 1 sec, only regens either health or armor at a time
 - **Power Armor**: CTF's 1 damage per cell now applies across deathmatch (originally 2 damage per cell in all DM bar CTF) -- this means same protection but consumes roughly twice the cells.
 - Powerup spawn rules: 120 sec respawn default, 30-45 (randomised) initial spawn delay, global spawn and pickup sounds, spawn and pickup messages.

### Quake III Arena style (g_ruleset 3)
Inspired by Quake III Arena, this ruleset aims to replicate some of the differences:
 - Start with Machinegun and Rip Saw
 - Super Shotgun replaced by Shotgun
 - Weapon stats altered, including projectile velocity, spread and damage
 - Ammo stats altered, ammo max is 200 for each type.
 - Weapon pickup rule: +1 ammo if weapon is already held.
 - Armor system: no tiers, +5 shard value, armor always provides 66% protection
 - Health and armor counts down to max health
 - Spawning health bonus of 25.
 - Removed Mega timer rule, Mega Health respawns after 60 seconds
 - **Invulnerability** powerup has been replaced by Protection - player receives no splash damage, full protection from slime damage, third protection from lava, half direct damage after armor protection.
 - Powerup spawn rules: 120 sec respawn default, 30-45 (randomised) initial spawn delay, global spawn and pickup sounds.

### Map Tweaks
Some entity overrides are included which add some subtle ambient sounds, mover sounds, intermission cams and gametype-specific item tweaks.
 
### Map Entity Controls
 * Map Item Replacement Control:
	 - **<disable/replace>_[classname]** and **[mapname]_<disable/replace>_[classname]** user cvars to remove or replace specific DM map items (by classname) or only in specific maps if desired
 * Save and load .ent files to override entire map entity string, located in baseq2/$g_entity_override_dir$/[mapname].ent:
	 - **g_entity_override_dir**: overrides entity override file subdir within baseq2 (default: maps)

	team: Team Deathmatch
	ctf: Capture the Flag
	ca: Clan Arena
	ft: Freeze Tag
	rr: Red Rover
	lms: Last Man Standing

		Example: "gametype" "ffa tournament" - this will spawn the entity only in deathmatches and duels.
 * New entity keys**: "**notteam**" and "**notfree**": removes an entity from team gametypes or non-team gametypes respectively.
	Example: "**notteam**" "1" - the entity will not spawn in team gametypes such as TDM, CTF, FreezeTag and Clan Arena.

 * new item spawnflag & 8: item spawns in suspended state (does not drop to floor)
 * Hacky Map Fixes:

 * "nobots" and "nohumans": keys for info_player_deathmatch to avoid using for bots or humans respectively
	
### Entity Keys
* SPAWNFLAGS:
	- spawnflags & 8: suspends items (don't fall to ground)
