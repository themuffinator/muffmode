# Muff Mode

Muff Mode is a server-side overhaul for [Quake II Remastered](https://github.com/id-Software/quake2-rerelease-dll). It packages updated game logic, curated configs, bot data, and entity overrides so hosts can spin up modernized multiplayer servers with minimal setup.

## Quick Start
1. Back up `rerelease/baseq2/game_x64.dll` in your Quake II install (`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Quake 2\` by default on Steam).
2. Download the latest [Muff Mode release](https://github.com/themuffinator/muffmode/releases/latest).
3. Extract the archive into the root Quake II folder and allow the DLL replacement.
4. Launch the game, create a lobby, then run `exec muff-sv.cfg` to load the bundled server preset.

## Project Highlights
- Round-based and objective-focused gametypes with supporting mutators.
- A purpose-built HUD, scoreboard, and in-game control menu for players.
- Extensive admin and voting commands, plus EyeCam spectating tools.
- Designer-facing entity additions enabling Quake IIIâ€“style encounter scripting.
